Q-Describe the usage of the comma operator in JavaScript and provide an example.
A- Multiple Expressions: The comma operator in JavaScript lets you combine multiple expressions into a single line.
   Evaluation: It evaluates each expression from left to right, and the result is the value of the rightmost expression.
   Example: var a = 2, b = 3; - here, both a and b get assigned values, and the value of b (3) is the overall result.
   var a = 2, b = 3;
